            <p>
                Hello, and welcome! This is an unfinished project of our imaginary house that me 
                and my friends created with our imagination, the internet, and story telling.
                So to whoever is reading this, I hope you have fun and enjoy with our tour!
            </p>

            <h2> How Was This Created? </h2>

            <p>
                At first this fun little project was just made for the fun for two people. But after a while 
                a third person joined. What was once a small story and a google doc of what the house would 
                look like, became into this small website. A small website that was made from scratch, and made for fun.

            </p>


            <h2>Program Staff</h2>

            <!-- Step 4:
                Display all the staff inline -->
